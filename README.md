# Arduino-Digital-Car-RPM
This is my first Arduino project. An Arduino powered digital RPM and speedometer. I still haven't completed this 100%, but I thought of sharing what I have done with you guys.

Please note that some of the codes of this project I have taken from internet. So credits for them go to those developers.

You can get my codes here:
